Moben’s first exhibitions in China was in 2005 while he simultaneously exhibited the first part of the Mechanics of Emotions grand œuvre, converting symbolically the 700 sqm of 18 on the Bund gallery in Shanghai - into a luxury shop with e-Market, Emotional Market, and presenting a giant installation in the Shanghai Science Museum with Cosmopolis installation which attracted more than 10 000 people per day. This exhibition, one of the major events of the French Year, toured around China and was the opening exhibition of the 3 Gorges Museum in ChongQing, before being presented in Chengdu and Beijing. Neorizon, his last exhibition in Shanghai, was a large-scale street installation on Century Avenue during eArts Festival 2008. On September 2014, MoBen co-curated with Jeffrey Shaw the Fleeting Light Large Scale interactive art exhibition including the first artist’s work of the ICC Tower giant urban media screen by Jim Campbell. This experience in Asia was the origin of important mutations in MoBen’s work and largely it motivated his decision to move to Hong Kong in 2012.\nMoBen’s work has won more than 20 international awards, including the Villa Medicis Hors les Murs, more than four Ars Electronica awards (including the coveted Golden Nica), Siggraph, Imagina, SACD and 4 International Monitor Awards.

A projector can be used to control light reflected from an object, where the reflected light depends not only on the projection but also on the reflectance and environmental light. Because the resulting colors are affected by the reflectance and environmental light, the presentable color range of a projector is limited. The purpose of this work is to broaden this limited range by focusing on the perceived colors. Although our eyes capture reflected light to perceive the colors of an object, the colors perceived by humans are not always the same as the actual colors, and there are often significant differences between them because of the human visual system. To overcome the limitations of a projector based on human perception, we intentionally generate this difference by inducing a visual illusion, namely, color constancy. In this work, we designed an algorithm to determine the projected colors for presenting the desired colors perceptually by employing a color constancy effect. In addition, we conducted a user study and confirmed that our algorithm can (1) create a misperception regarding the color of illumination, (2) broaden the presentable color range of a projector, and (3) shift the perceptual colors in the desirable direction.","tags":null,"title":"Illusory light: Perceptual appearance control using a projection-induced illusion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pui Chung Wong (Tony)","Kening Zhu","Xing-Dong Yang","Hongbo Fu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590969600,"objectID":"c1dc6b593d1b6d7126f614269f070fd6","permalink":"https://xr-lab.org/publication/pui-chung-chi-2020/","publishdate":"2020-05-16T10:01:44.941659Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pui-chung-chi-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Exploring Eyes-Free Bezel-Initiated Swipe on Round Smartwatches","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dávid Maruscsák","Alvaro Cassinelli","Christian Sandor"],"categories":null,"content":"AURA is an interactive installation designed for the 360° projection theatre immersive system.

The master’s feverish daydreaming coupled with his unparalleled erudition produces something that is more accessible than the scribblings of the scientist, and more touching than the sketches of the artist, because it reminds us of the all encompassing curiosity of a child.

Perhaps involuntarily, Leonardo Da Vinci elevated an early form of multimedia documenting to the level of Art.

Therefore, seeing a person’s dreams would be the most direct path to understanding their intuitive cognitive processes.\nThe goal of this piece is to offer viewers a glimpse into Leonardo’s mental universe. To do so, I have trained a neural network to ‘dream up’ new notebook illustrations, similar in spirit to those of Leonardo. Viewers can interact with this generative process and explore the underlying cognitive processes that attempt to be a modern version of Leonardo’s Renaissance mind.\nNeural networks imitate the learning process of a human Brian: through a combination of observation and trial and error, pathways in the brain leading to successful behavior are reinforced, whereas pathways leading to failure are inhibited. For understanding signals as diverse as audio, images, and text, neural networks now offer the most successful means of doing so, in some cases even surpassing human accuracy.\nTo compress the slow human learning process into manageable time frames, neural networks are now being trained with huge amounts of data and computing power. For example, Nvidia’s StyleGAN was once trained on 2.8 million cat images with computing power equivalent to the world’s fastest supercomputer running for one hour. My approach has been to train StyleGAN with the 1119 pages contained in the Veneranda Biblioteca Ambrosiana’s Codex Atlanticus.

In this paper, we create HoloRoyale, the first large scale high fidelity (LSHF) CAR experience. We do this by first exploring the LSHF CAR design space, drawing on technical implementations and design aspects from AR and video games. We then create and implement a software architecture that improves the accuracy of synchronized poses between multiple users. Finally, we apply our target experience and technical implementation to the explored design space. A core design component of HoloRoyale is the use of visual repellers as crowd control elements to guide players away from undesired areas. To evaluate the effectiveness of the employed visual repellers in a LSHF CAR context we conducted a user study, deploying HoloRoyale in a 12.500 m2 area. The results from the user study suggest that visual repellers are effective crowd control elements that do not significantly impact the user’s overall immersion. Overall our main contribution is the exploration of a design space, discussing several means to address the challenges of LSHF CAR, the creation of a system capable of LSHF CAR interactions along with an experience that has been fitted to the design space, and an indepth study that verifies a key design aspect for LSHF CAR. As such, our work is the first to explore the domain of LSHF CAR and provides insight into designing experiences in other AR domains.","tags":["Augmented reality","Game design","High fidelity","Large scale interaction"],"title":"Towards large scale high fidelity collaborative augmented reality","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zheer Xu","Pui Chung Wong (Tony)","Jun Gong","Te-Yen Wu","Aditya Shekhar Nittala","Xiaojun Bi","Jürgen Steimle","Hongbo Fu","Kening Zhu","Xing-Dong Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1569888000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569888000,"objectID":"0a7cd659b943c472211cdf6286b4e7c6","permalink":"https://xr-lab.org/publication/pui-chung-acm-2019/","publishdate":"2020-05-16T10:01:44.943259Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pui-chung-acm-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"TipText: Eyes-Free Text Entry on a Fingertip Keyboard","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ryo Akiyama","Goshiro Yamamoto","Toshiyuki Amano","Takafumi Taketomi","Alexander Plopski","Christian Sandor","Hirokazu Kato"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"9461714e8221c7f4927915328b64adc8","permalink":"https://xr-lab.org/publication/akiyama-robust-2019/","publishdate":"2020-08-11T09:12:39.865399Z","relpermalink":"/publication/akiyama-robust-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a novel method that robustly estimates the reﬂectance, even in an environment with dynamically changing light. To control the appearance of an object by using a projector–camera system, an appropriate estimate of the object’s reﬂectance is vital to the creation of an appropriate projection image. Most conventional estimation methods assume static light conditions; however, in practice, the appearance is affected by both the reﬂectance and environmental light. In an environment with dynamically changing light, conventional reﬂectance estimation methods require calibration every time the conditions change. In contrast, our method requires no additional calibration because it simultaneously estimates both the reﬂectance and environmental light. Our method is based on the concept of creating two different light conditions by switching the projection at a rate higher than that perceived by the human eye and captures the images of a target object separately under each condition. The reﬂectance and environmental light are then simultaneously estimated by using the pair of images acquired under these two conditions. We implemented a projector–camera system that switches the projection on and off at 120 Hz. Experiments conﬁrm the robustness of our method when changing the environmental light. Further, our method can robustly estimate the reﬂectance under practical indoor lighting conditions.","tags":null,"title":"Robust Reflectance Estimation for Projection-Based Appearance Control in a Dynamic Light Environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel Eckhoff","Alvaro Cassinelli","Christian Sandor"],"categories":null,"content":" We will investigate perceptual and cognitive responses of users of several extreme Augmented Reality experiences on an Optical See-Through Head-Mounted Display (a).

One of the important hand functions that deteriorate over time is the ability to control finger force exertion, due to the gradual decrease in finger muscle strength as people age. Previous studies have shown that with proper training, it is possible to regain finger strength. However, when designing training systems for finger force control, visualization of the finger forces plays an important role in its effectiveness. In this paper, we describe the development of the augmented reality pressing and evaluation system (AR-PETS), an augmented reality based prototype system for finger force control training. We discuss the development of the system, as well as the design considerations during the development of the system.","tags":["Augmented reality","Finger force training","Gamification","Pressing evaluation and training system"],"title":"Integration of Augmented Reality with Pressing Evaluation and Training System for Finger Force Training","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hiraku Nakamura","Tatsuya Sonobe","Hiroyuki Toda","Naomi Fujisawa","Takafumi Taketomi","Alexander Plopski","Christian Sandor","Hirokazu Kato"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559347200,"objectID":"a8f7f4f34d418bd3aec2a9f3b2cdcf5b","permalink":"https://xr-lab.org/publication/nakamura-robust-2019/","publishdate":"2020-08-11T09:12:39.863112Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nakamura-robust-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Robust Positioning Method for Berthing Support Using Fusion of Tightly Coupled GNSS Carrier Phase with IMU and Visual Odometry.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Klen Čopič Pucihar","Christian Sandor","Matjaž Kljun","Wolfgang Huerst","Alexander Plopski","Takafumi Taketomi","Hirokazu Kato","Luis A.

A review of related work reveals that current approaches fail due to limited detection fidelity and spatial resolution. Our proposal, based on Google Soli’s radar sensing technology, is designed to detect micro-gestures on objects with sub-millimeter precision. Preliminary results with a custom gesture set show that Soli’s core features and traditional machine learning models (Random Forest and Support Vector Machine) do not lead to robust recognition accuracy, and so more advanced techniques should be used instead, possibly incorporating additional sensor features.","tags":null,"title":"The Missing Interface: Micro-Gestures on Augmented Objects","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ryo Akiyama","Goshiro Yamamoto","Toshiyuki Amano","Takafumi Taketomi","Alexander Plopski","Christian Sandor","Hirokazu Kato"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1551398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551398400,"objectID":"1f671513f305cba57074a42bddb6bf59","permalink":"https://xr-lab.org/publication/akiyama-perceptual-2019/","publishdate":"2020-08-11T09:12:39.862186Z","relpermalink":"/publication/akiyama-perceptual-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Using projection mapping, we can control the appearance of realworld objects by projecting colored light onto them. Since a projector can only add illumination to the scene, limited color gamut can be presented through projection mapping. However, actual color and perceived color are not always the same, and there is often large difference between them. We intentionally generate this difference by inducing visual illusion for extending the controllable color gamut of a projector. In particular, we induce color constancy. We demonstrate changing object color with and without inducing color constancy. Audiences perceive the controlled colors with and without illusion as different color nevertheless these colors are physically completely same.","tags":null,"title":"Perceptual Appearance Control by

aging is an inevitable social problem in many developed countries. In order to manage this issue, it is necessary to drastically change the welfare security and labor system of relevant societies. We have proposed ``mosaic-type work'' in which a single ``virtual worker'' is synthesized based on individual workers and seniors through seamless information sharing. In this paper, we specifically focus on the spatial part of the mosaic, namely, the ``spatial mosaic,'' for enabling seniors to work without the burden of movement. Towards the actualization of this concept, we aimed to develop senior-friendly mobile avatar robots that can fit into seniors' daily lives. First, we analyzed problems of seniors' telecommunication with telepresence robots, and two elemental interfaces, the ``physically operable interface'' and the ``acoustic zooming interface.'' The former is a senior-friendly interface that the seniors can manipulate with their motion, and the latter enables the user to listen to sounds in a specified area that the user can adjust. In order to discuss integrated interface designs, we conducted two exploratory experiments to evaluate the performance of these systems.","tags":null,"title":"Practical Use of a Remote Movable Avatar Robot with an Immersive Interface for Seniors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simon Julier","Robert W.

Conventional telepresence research have focused on the exact re-creation of face-to-face communication at a fixed position in a specialized room, so there have been much less research on a life-sized mobile telepresence system despite many off-the-shelf mobile telepresence robots available. We propose various scalable holographic displays to visualize a life-sized avatar in an actual life. In addition, we introduce architecture to control embodied avatar according to user's intention by extending popular architecture for a multimodal virtual human, namely SAIBA. Our primitive prototype system was tested with 5 simple avatar animations to embody with a wheeled platform robot and a life-sized transparent holographic display and proved realistic avatar's movement complying user's intention and the situation at the remote location of avatar.","tags":null,"title":"Towards Mobile Embodied 3D Avatar as Telepresence Vehicle","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Weir","Christian Sandor","Matt Swoboda","Thanh Nguyen","Ulrich Eck","Gerhard Reitmayr","Arindam Dey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1351728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1351728000,"objectID":"53556876e412772d84737bbc641b28d4","permalink":"https://xr-lab.org/publication/weir-12-ismar/","publishdate":"2019-12-16T16:55:31.199409Z","relpermalink":"/publication/weir-12-ismar/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"BurnAR: Feel the Heat","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Csongei","Liem Hoang","Ulrich Eck","Christian Sandor"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1351728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1351728000,"objectID":"059305560f2275fd248d3db702bdf615","permalink":"https://xr-lab.org/publication/csongei-12-ismar/","publishdate":"2019-12-16T16:55:31.168494Z","relpermalink":"/publication/csongei-12-ismar/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"ClonAR: Rapid Redesign of Real-World Objects","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alvaro Cassinelli","Jussi Angesleva","Yoshihiro Watanabe","Gonzalo Frasca","Masatoshi Ishikawa"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1351728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1351728000,"objectID":"9dc3ede87583a5983d94b3cbb0cf4619","permalink":"https://xr-lab.org/publication/cassinelli-skin-2012/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T09:26:17.135701Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cassinelli-skin-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Skin Games","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Arindam Dey","Graeme Jarvis","Christian Sandor","Gerhard Reitmayr"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1351728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1351728000,"objectID":"85ecb93b935bb0bd4465bbcc80f36599","permalink":"https://xr-lab.org/publication/dey-12-ismar/","publishdate":"2019-12-16T16:55:31.140643Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dey-12-ismar/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tablet versus Phone: Depth Perception in Handheld Augmented Reality","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Patrick Maier","Arindam Dey","Christian A.

This doctoral research aims to contribute to the development of PTSD treatment by investigating the potential of Augmented Reality (AR) narrative in treating PTSD. This four-year research project consists of three steps. In the first stage of research, we will conduct a comparative study between AR and VR narratives with participants without mental illnesses to verify whether AR narratives work better in eliciting the emotional engagement of the participants than VR narratives. In the second stage, we will create a system that integrates AR narratives with prolonged exposure (PE) treatment and experiment it with PTSD patients to verify its treatment efficacy. In the final stage, a semi-automatic and patient-authored AR system is expected to be achieved, through which the patients can design their unique exposure environment via voice input.

The thesis aims to answer the following question; what are the philosophical, scientific and technological links between altered states of consciousness and technology which have given rise to the increasing use of VR and AR as empirical tools for simulating meditative and psychedelic brain states. The hypothesis of this research draws from the philosophy of technology and theories of consciousness in the neurosciences to argue that the immersive qualities of VR and AR technologies mediate altered states of consciousness. These theoretical frameworks will inform the production of AR and VR systems that will be used in experimental studies to determine whether these technologies have the capacity for capturing the visual phenomenology of profound psychological experiences which physiological brain imaging technologies are incapable of articulating. The first experiment will involve the development of a VR meditation system that digitally simulates the visualization techniques in Vajrayana buddhist meditation while using EEG brain computer interface to create bio feedback between the virtual simulations of buddhist cosmology and the users meditative state. This artwork proposes that VR buddhist meditation apps are the continuation of a tradition of visual art used as meditation aids in Tibetan and Tantric Buddhism. The second experiment is an art science collaboration that draws from neuroimaging research on psychedelic brain states which has demonstrated increased cerebral blood flow and decreased alpha brain wave activity as key indicators of altered states of consciousness. Alpha activity is usually associated with filtering ‘stimulus irrelevant’ input in the visual cortex and reduced alpha is proposed to have a ‘disinhibitory’ effect producing anarchic patterns of stimulation associated with hallucinations. An acknowledged gap in this research is that examining only the ‘neural correlates of consciousness’ of hallucination neglects the visual phenomenological experience of these states which would be aided by the ‘improved capture of visual hallucinations.’ A mixed reality system will be developed for inducing hallucinations based on predictive processing and sensorimotor contingency theories of visual consciousness through the simulation of simple and complex imagery which is responsive to the eye tracking of the hololens system.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"d1faafa61ed6f7f6a7fdca078db49759","permalink":"https://xr-lab.org/project/psychotechnics/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/psychotechnics/","section":"project","summary":"2020-","tags":null,"title":"VIRTUAL PSYCHOTECHNICS: SIMULATING THE VISUAL PHENOMENOLOGY OF HALLUCINATION","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://xr-lab.org/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"XRL Team","tags":null,"title":"XRL Team","type":"widget_page"}]
