	abstract = {In this proposed Ph.D. research, we are aiming to create several extreme Augmented Reality (AR) that evoke measurable physiological and neurological responses in the human brain. These experiments will run on a platform capable of tracking the user’s body and recreating a volumetric representations of it. On a Head-Mounted Display, we will overlay real-time photo-realistic stereoscopic graphics on the user’s body.},
