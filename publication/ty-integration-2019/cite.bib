 abstract = {One major concern for the elderly is the decline in their ability to control their hands, which can significantly affect their ability to perform activities of daily living. One of the important hand functions that deteriorate over time is the ability to control finger force exertion, due to the gradual decrease in finger muscle strength as people age. Previous studies have shown that with proper training, it is possible to regain finger strength. However, when designing training systems for finger force control, visualization of the finger forces plays an important role in its effectiveness. In this paper, we describe the development of the augmented reality pressing and evaluation system (AR-PETS), an augmented reality based prototype system for finger force control training. We discuss the development of the system, as well as the design considerations during the development of the system.},
