	abstract = {This paper focuses on the present and near-future possibilities and technologies for wearable augmented reality. The paper provides an overview of the concept of wearable augmented reality and describes a current state-of-the-art system Tinmith. A number of benefits are presented, such as in situ information presentation, hands-free operation, ability to multitask, and navigation aids. The following five major application domains are examined as a means of highlighting the effectiveness of this technology: consumer help, entertainment, manufacturing, medicine, and navigation. The article provides some insights into technological hurdles yet to be overcome.},
